# Case Studies

This section contains end-to-end product case studies that illustrate how product problems are approached, analysed, and solved.

Each case study typically covers:
- Problem context and constraints
- Business and user objectives
- Discovery activities and assumptions
- Options analysis and trade-offs
- Product decisions and rationale
- Metrics and impact assessment
- Learnings and retrospectives

Case studies may be based on real scenarios (anonymised) or realistic fictitious products designed to demonstrate structured product thinking.
