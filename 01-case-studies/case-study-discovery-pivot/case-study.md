# Case Study: Pivoting Product Direction After Invalidating a Core Assumption

## 1. Context
We initiated a product initiative aimed at addressing a perceived user problem that had been repeatedly raised through stakeholder feedback and high-level signals (e.g. feature requests, anecdotal feedback, roadmap inputs).

The initiative was positioned as a meaningful value driver and was included in the roadmap before in-depth discovery had been completed.

- Product / domain: Digital product feature aimed at improving user efficiency
- Target users: Existing active users within a specific workflow
- Environment: Mature product with an established user base
- Constraints: Fixed delivery window, limited discovery capacity upfront, roadmap commitments
